The purpose of this project is to implement a state driven e commerce Fruit application. 
This uses SwiftUI and Combine. 
Network logic invovles making use of combine. 
Unit tests are written to make sure the requirements of the project are working correctly. 

This architecture followed is MVVM, I have used Codable for data models, views are designed by SwiftUI, viewModels contain all the business logic.
